// Package follower defines the Follower type. It is used to track a specific artifact version denoted by its tag.
// Periodically it checks if a new version has been pushed and if so pulls and installs it in a given directory.
// Each Follower can track only one artifact, if you need to track multiple artiacts then instantiate a follower for each one.
